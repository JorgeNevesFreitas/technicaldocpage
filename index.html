          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web
          pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what
          CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms
          about the language.

        <p>
          As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how
          documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable
          by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are
          designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer
          screen, projector, or printer.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example,
          for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used
          to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into
          a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related
          information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="css_syntax">
        <header>CSS syntax</header>
        <p>
          CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying
          groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or
          groups of elements on your web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to
          be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS
          rule that would achieve the styling described above:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code> h1 { color: red;</code>
          <code>font-size: 5em; } </code>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector . This
            selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case,
            we are styling level one headings (h1).
          </li>
          <li>We then have a set of curly braces { }.</li>
          <li>
            Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the
            form of property and value pairs.
            <ul>
              <li>
                We specify the property (color in the above example) before the
                colon;
              </li>
              <li>
                And we specify the value of the property after the colon (red in
                this example).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other
            for font-size. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we
            are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd like to give
            the property.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which
          property is being specified. In our example, we have the color
          property, which can take various color values. We also have the
          font-size property. This property can take various size units as a
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code> h1 { color: red;</code>
          <code> font-size: 5em; }</code>
          <code> p { color: black; } </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are
          defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which
          are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG,
          ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are
          supposed to behave.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called
          the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives of
          browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS. There
          are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as
          independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group —
          sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some
          capability, other times because web designers and developers are
          asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself
          has identified a requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new
          features becoming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that
          everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would
          break old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS
          available then, should still be usable in a browser today!
        </p>
        <p>
          As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs
          overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement
          support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to
          read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather
          refer to MDN documentation or other tutorials. Nevertheless, it is
          worth knowing that these specs exist and understanding the
          relationship between the CSS you are using, the browser support (see
          below), and the specs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="browser_support_information">
        <header>Browser support information</header>
        <p>
          After a CSS feature has been specified, then it is only useful for us
          in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented the
          feature. This means that the code has been written to turn the
          instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the
          screen. We'll look at this process more in the lesson How CSS works.
          It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same
          time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS
          in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able to
          check implementation status is useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          he browser support status is shown on every MDN CSS property page in a
          section named "Browser compatibility" — use information in this
          section to check if the property can be used on your website. For
          example, the compatibility section for the CSS font-family property is
          reproduced below. Based on your requirements, you can use the Browser
          compatibility table to check how this property is supported across
          various browsers, or check if your specific browser and the version
          you have support the property, or if there are any caveats you should
          be aware of for the browser and version you are using.
